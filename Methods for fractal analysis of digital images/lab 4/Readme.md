# Task 4.
Task: For a grayscale image, calculate its Minkowski dimension using the veil construction method.

How to run:
* Go to the folder containing the program code and image

* Type in the console "python count_dimension_cover.py" or "python3 count_dimension_cover.py"

* You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file located in the same folder as the program code. If you don't enter any name, the default program will try to find a file named "image.jpg"

* The image you submit for entry may be in color. The program itself will invert it into a black and white image, saving it with the name "inverted_" + the name of the original image

* Next, you will be shown the result of the program: the dimensions of the image in pixels and its fractal dimension.
