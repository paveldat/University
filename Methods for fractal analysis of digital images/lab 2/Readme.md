# Task 2.
Task: For an arbitrary RGB color image, select one of the components of the palette. Show result.

How to run:
* Go to the folder containing the program code and image

* Type in the console "python convert_to_grayscale.py" or "python3 convert_to_grayscale.py"

* You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file located in the same folder as the program code. If you don't enter any name, the default program will try to find a file named "image.jpg"

* You will be prompted to enter a letter representing the color. "R" stands for red, "G" for green, "B" for blue. If you don't enter any color, the program will default to red.

* Next, the modified image will be saved under the name "result.png"
