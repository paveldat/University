# Task 7.
Task: Calculate the vector of Minkowski dimensions for the selected image when resizing the split cell.

How to run:
* Go to the folder containing the program code and image

* Type in the console "python count_vector.py" or "python3 count_vector.py"

* You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file located in the same folder as the program code. If you don't enter any name, the default program will try to find a file named "image.jpg"

* To plot multiple files, enter multiple image names separated by spaces: "image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg"

* The image you submit for entry may be in color. The program itself will invert it into a black and white image, saving it with the name "inverted_" + the name of the original image

* Next, the file "result_graph.png" will be created
