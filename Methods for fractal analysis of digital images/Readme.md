# Task 1. Calculation of the fractal dimension
# Task 2. For an arbitrary RGB color image, select one of the components of the palette. Show result.
# Task 3. Convert a color image to grayscale. Show result.
# Task 4. For a grayscale image, calculate its Minkowski dimension using the veil construction method.
# Task 5. Build image segmentation based on segment surface area calculation.
# Task 6. Calculate the value vector ln(𝐴𝛿)/ln(𝛿) 𝛿=1,..10. (You can use both symmetric and asymmetric methods).
# Task 7. Calculate the vector of Minkowski dimensions for the selected image when resizing the split cell.
