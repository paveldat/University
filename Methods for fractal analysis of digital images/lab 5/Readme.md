# Task 5.
Task: Build image segmentation based on segment surface area calculation.

How to run:
* Go to the folder containing the program code and image

* Type in the console "python build_sergemtation.py" or "python3 build_sergemtation.py"

* You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file located in the same folder as the program code. If you don't enter any name, the default program will try to find a file named "image.jpg"

* The image you submit for entry may be in color. The program itself will invert it into a black and white image, saving it with the name "inverted_" + the name of the original image

* Next, the file "segmented_" + the name of the original image will be created
