# Task 1. Calculation of the fractal dimension
Task: Calculate the capacitive dimension for a black and white image using the least squares method.

How to run:
* Go to the folder containing the program code and image

* Type in the console "python count_dimension.py" or "python3 count_dimension.py"

* You will be prompted to enter the name of the image file located in the same folder as the program code. If you don't enter any name, the default program will try to find a file named "image.jpg"

* Next, you will be shown the result of the program: the dimensions of the image in pixels and its fractal dimension.

* The image you submit for entry may be in color. The program itself will invert it into a black and white image, saving it with the name "inverted_" + the name of the original image
